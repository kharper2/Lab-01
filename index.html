  <p>Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <h1>Kathryn Harper</h1>
  <p>Hi! I'm currently a senior at Jones College Prep and I would like to study CS in the future.</p>
  <p>I am familiar with HTML and CSS. In Girls Who Code, we are actually creating a school website.</p> 
  <p>I'm excited to learn more about web development in this course.</p>
